Case Study: Predicting Medical Charges  Using Linear Regression 
Tasks: 
      Data Preprocessing:
                            1. Handle missing or anomalous data.
                            2. Convert categorical variables (sex, smoker, region) into numerical formats using 
                            encoding techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding).
                            3. Normalize/standardize numerical features if required.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
                            1. Analyze the distribution of key variables (e.g., age, bmi, charges).
                            2. Investigate relationships between features and the target variable (charges).
                            3. Identify potential outliers or influential points.
    Model Development:
                            1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
                            2. Implement a linear regression model.
                            3. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., R-squared, Mean Squared 
                            Error).
      Model Interpretation:
                            1. Interpret the coefficients of the linear regression model.
                            2. Discuss the impact of different features on medical charges.
